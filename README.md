# Garbage Patch Data Workflow.
This is a record of the workflow used to create the base map seen [here](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/Study-Shows-the-Great-Pacific-Garbage-Patch-is-Growing-478553413.html). H/T to Thomas Thoren's [Making a New York Times map](https://thomasthoren.com/2016/02/28/making-a-new-york-times-map.html).

## Requirements
This uses GDAL and Mike Bostock's geo2topo libraries to manipulate and raster geographic data, and imagemagick to work with images from the command line. Satellite imagery found using [Derek Watkins's SRTM Tile Grabber](http://dwtkns.com/srtm/).
